### OVERVIEW ###

This benchmark suite contains 9 typical micro workloads:

  **Spark Core:**

1. Sort (sort)

    This workload sorts its *text* input data, which is generated
    using RandomTextWriter.

2. WordCount (wordcount)

    This workload counts the occurrence of each word in the input
    data, which are generated using RandomTextWriter. It is
    representative of another typical class of real world MapReduce
    jobs - extracting a small amount of interesting data from large
    data set.

3. Sleep (sleep)

    This workload sleep an amount of seconds in each task to verify
    task scheduler.

  **Spark SQL:**

4. Scan (scan)

    Measure the throughput of the SparkSql cluster by query a large
    table and write the result back to HDFS:

    `FROM rankings SELECT *`

5. Join (join)

    Join two large tables with some `WHERE` conditions, `GROUP BY` and
    `ORDER BY` operations:
   
    `SELECT sourceIP, sum(adRevenue) as totalRevenue, avg(pageRank)
    FROM rankings R JOIN (SELECT sourceIP, destURL, adRevenue FROM
    uservisits UV WHERE (datediff(UV.visitDate, '1999-01-01')>=0 AND
    datediff(UV.visitDate, '2000-01-01')<=0)) NUV ON (R.pageURL =
    NUV.destURL) group by sourceIP order by totalRevenue DESC limit 1`

6. Aggregate (aggregation)

   Query large table with `SUM` and `GROUP BY` operations:

   `SELECT sourceIP, SUM(adRevenue) FROM uservisits GROUP BY sourceIP`

  **Spark Graphx:**

7. PageRank (pagerank)

    This workload benchmarks PageRank algorithm implemented in
    Spark-MLLib examples. The data source is generated from Web data
    whose hyperlinks follow the Zipfian distribution.

  **Spark MLLib:**

8. Bayesian Classification (bayes)

    This workload benchmarks NaiveBayesian Classification implemented
    in Spark-MLLib examples.

    Large-scale machine learning is another important use of
    MapReduce. This workload tests the Naive Bayesian (a popular
    classification algorithm for knowledge discovery and data mining)
    trainer in Mahout 0.7, which is an open source (Apache project)
    machine learning library. The workload uses the automatically
    generated documents whose words follow the zipfian
    distribution. The dict used for text generation is also from the
    default linux file /usr/share/dict/linux.words.

9. K-means clustering (kmeans)

    This workload tests the K-means (a well-known clustering algorithm
    for knowledge discovery and data mining) clustering in Mahout
    0.7. The input data set is generated by GenKMeansDataset based on
    Uniform Distribution and Guassian Distribution.

### Getting Started ###

2. Prerequisites

  1. Setup JDK-1.6(suggested)

      Download Oracle-JDK-1.6 and setup properly.

      Note: Due to
      [SPARK-1703](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-1703)
      and
      [SPARK-1911](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-1911),
      Oracle-JDK-1.6 is the suggested option which passes all tests.

      Other JDK versions such as Oracle-JDK-1.7 and Oracle-JDK-1.8 are
      also supported if python related workloads can be discarded. 

  2. Setup HiBench-3.0

      Download/Checkout HiBench-3.0 benchmark suite from
      [https://github.com/intel-hadoop/HiBench](https://github.com/intel-hadoop/HiBench).
      Download packages depended by hibench:

            cd HiBench/common/hibench
            mvn process-sources

      Recompile DataTools for HiBench with JDK1.6:

            cd HiBench/common/autogen
            ant package

  3. Setup Hadoop

      Before you run any workload in the package, please verify the
      Hadoop framework is running correctly. Both Hadoop 1.x and
      Hadoop-YARN are supported & tested. Currently, the suggested
      version is Hadoop 1.0.4 which is heavily tested.

  4. Setup Spark

      Download/Checkout spark from
      [https://github.com/apache/spark](https://github.com/apache/spark).
      Use spark 1.3.0 or later versions.

      For hadoop 1.0.4, standalone mode only:
      
      `./make-distribution.sh --name spark --tgz -Phive`

      For hadoop with yarn support:

      `./make-distribution.sh --name spark-yarn --tgz -Phive -Pyarn -Dhadoop.version=2.x.x -Dyarn.version=2.x.x`
      
      Please refer to `Known Issues` to set `conf/spark-default.conf`
      properly.

  5. Setup SparkBench

      Download/checkout SparkBench benchmark suite from
      [https://github.com/intel-bigdata/Sparkbench](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/Sparkbench/archive/master.zip).

      Edit `common/pom.xml', set `spark.version` and `spark.bin.version` accordingly. Note, currently `spark.bin.version` only supports `1.2` and `1.3`.

  6. Setup `numpy` in all nodes for Python related MLLib workloads. (numpy version > 1.4)

     For CentOS(6.2+):
     
     `yum inlstall numpy`

     For Ubuntu/Debian:

     `aptitude install python-numpy`

  7. Setup for SparkBench/report_gen_plot.py (Optional)
  
     Install python-matplotlib with verion of 0.9+

     For CentOS(6.2+):
     
     `yum inlstall python-matplotlib`

     For Ubuntu/Debian:

     `aptitude install python-matplotlib`

2. Configure for the all workloads

    You need to set some global environment variables in the
    `conf/sparkbench-config.sh` file located in the root dir. 

          HADOOP_HOME            < The Hadoop installation location >
          SPARK_HOME             < The Spark installation location >
          HADOOP_HOME            < The HiBench installation location >
          HDFS_MASTER            < HDFS master >
          SPARK_MASTER           < SPARK master >
          HADOOP_CONF_DIR        < The hadoop configuration DIR >
          HADOOP_EXAMPLES_JAR    < The path to hadoop-examples-xxx.jar >
          SPARK_CONF_DIR         < The Spark config DIR >
          SPARK_EXAMPLES_JAR     < The path to spark-examples-xxx.jar >
          DICT_PATH              < The dict location >
          DATA_PATH              < The base HDFS path to hold HiBench data >
          SPARKBENCH_REPORT      < The path to SparkBench reports >
          YARN_NUM_EXECTORS      < num executors in yarn mode >
          YARN_EXECUTOR_CORES    < num executor cores in yarn mode >
          YARN_EXECUTOR_MEMORY   < num of executor memory in yarn mode >

    Note:

      1.  SparkBench will guess the value of these variables if they
      are not explicitly set. If so, SparkBench guarantees neither the
      correctness of guess nor the success running of benchmarks.

      2. Do not change the default values of other global environment
      variables unless necessary.

3. Configure each workload

    You can modify the `conf/configure.sh` file under each workload
    folder if it exists. All the data size and options related to the
    workload are defined in this file.

4. Synchronize the time on all nodes (optional but recommended)

5. Build

    You will need to execute `bin/build-all.sh` to build all
    workloads. (Assume `maven` is installed properly and accessible in
    `$PATH`). By default it will build HiBench with hadoop2 and
    spark1.3 API.

    For running HiBench with Hadoop1 API, supply `-Dhadoop1`, and for
    running HiBench with Spark1.2 API, supply `-Dspark1.2`. For
    example, building Hibench with Hadoop1 and Spark1.2 API:

          cd <HiBench root>/src
          mvn clean package -D hadoop1 -D spark1.2

    Remember to update values of `HADOOP_VERSION` in
    `conf/sparkbench-config.sh` accordingly.

### Running ###

- Run several workloads sequentially

  The `conf/benchmarks.lst` file under the package folder defines the
  workloads to run when you execute the `bin/run-all.sh` script under
  the package folder. Each line in the list file specifies one
  workload. You can use `#` at the beginning of each line to skip the
  corresponding bench if necessary.

- Run each workload separately

  You can also run each workload separately. In general, there are 3
  different files under one workload folder.

      conf/configure.sh       Configuration file contains all parameters 
                              such as data size and test options.
      prepare/prepare.sh      Generate or copy the job input data into HDFS.
      java/bin/run.sh         Execute the java workload
      scala/bin/run.sh        Execute the scala workload
      python/bin/run.sh       Execute the python workload
      

  Follow the steps below to run a workload:

  1. Configure the benchmark:

      set your own configurations by modifying `configure.sh` if
      necessary.

  2. Prepare data:

      `prepare/prepare.sh` to prepare input data in HDFS for running the
      benchmark.

  3. Run the benchmark:

      `*/bin/run.sh` to run the corresponding benchmark.

  4. Plot the report:
      
      `${SPARKBENCH}/bin/report_gen_plot.py` to generate report figures.

      Note:
      
        `report_gen_plot.py` requires `python2.x` and `python-matplotlib`.
