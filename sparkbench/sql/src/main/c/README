This is my incomplete log of the changes that are being made and sent
out as part of the Approved Queries for tpcds. As you'll notice, it is
in reverse-chronological order.

Wed MArch 16th 
mpoess added q38.tpl as q39.tpl,q39.tpl as q40.tpl, q40.tpl as q41.tpl 
         and q41.tpl as q42.tpl (were voted in on January 20th)
       including two variants each in the vriant directory 
       Elapsed time variability for q41 q41_a and q41_b is too high. I am looking
       into this.

 
Tue March 14
mpoess added HP11 and HP15 as queries q37.tpl and q38.tpl (were voted in on January 20th 2005

Work done in Houston meeting: 
1. converted original queries to template form that can be run against qgen. 
     Issues: 
	- still missing q20
	- q4 template doesn't run cleanly

	- q27 template doesn't run cleanly on mine (uses cities distribution)

Problems:

$ grep SQL q*.out | grep -v SQL0100W | grep -v SQLSTATE
q1.out:SQL0206N  "WR_WEB_SITE_SK" is not valid in the context where it is used.  
q21.out:SQL0198N  The statement string of the PREPARE or EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement is 
q22.out:SQL0206N  "I_REC_START_DATE_ID" is not valid in the context where it is used.  


- Fixed q22, removed reference to i_rec_start_date_id to i_rec_start_date
